For thresholds I've been thinking about creating yaml resource and later mapping it into
nice set/map, however I think that keeping thresholds in static class is for now sufficient.
Also as we have static class, nothing stands on way to convert it to adapter for such yaml
file (keeping class static as it was, and reading resource in static block).

If you have any questions/suggestions, feel free to contact me, or hr representative.
